# Language Learning Model for SQL Query Generation

This project provides a function to invoke a Language Learning Model (LLM) for generating SQL queries based on given text inputs. 
It utilizes the LangChain library for building and interacting with language-based AI models.

## Functionality

The main functionality of this project is encapsulated in the `invoke_llm` function, which takes a query string and a 
Language Learning Model (LLM) instance as input and returns the response generated by the model. The function constructs 
a template for the query using the provided SQL template and then invokes the LLM to generate the SQL query based 
on the input text.

## Dependencies

- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/): A library for building and interacting with language-based AI models.
- [Model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF): Mistral model is used for generating SQL queries.

## Local deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/souravdas-crossml/sql-query-llm.git

cd sql-llm

mkdir model

python -m venv my_env

source my_env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

source .env

uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**NOTE:** Download and copy the model into the model directory from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/tree/main).
**NOTE:** Edit the .env file accoringly.
